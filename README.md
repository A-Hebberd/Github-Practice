<h1> GitHub Website Project </h1>

This repository serves for the host of my website. This repsitory contains the HTML host file, and any additional information regarding the development of the project.

The purpose of my node .gitignore file is to ignore everything contained in its list such as log and cache files. This prevents unnecessary files from being committed each time. Additionally, .gitignore makes pushing and committing changes for my repository faster, as it ignores any files under that list, meaning it only checks the relevant files outside the .gitignore list.
